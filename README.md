## Hi there! 

I’m Dhruvin, a developer who cares less about buzzwords and more about really understanding backend systems and DevOps..<br>

## About Me

For me, coding isn’t just a job—it’s something I take seriously. I focus on continuously improving my skills by building real projects, exploring new technologies, and doing deep dives into areas like the Linux ecosystem. I learn fast by experimenting, breaking things, and iterating on mistakes.

It uses WebSockets for live gameplay, Redis for fast matchmaking, and a backend architecture that reuses game rooms and strictly manages game states to efficiently handle many concurrent matches. The backend is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for consistent deployment and local setup.
