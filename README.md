## Hi there! 👋

I'm Dhruvin, a passionate coder set on becoming an honored software developer.<br>

## About Me

For me, coding isn't just a job—it's a genuine passion. I'm deeply dedicated to always learning and leveling up my programming skills. I love diving into new technologies and building exciting projects. I accelerate my mastery through continuous focused challenges, like deep dives into the <b>Linux ecosystem</b>, and by embracing a <b>'fail fast' approach to quickly learn and iterate from every mistake</b>.
